# Welcome to my personal website!

I've created the UI in React, and the backend Lambda/Api-gateway using Terraform. I've included my yarn.lock and .nvmrc to make it easy to pull down and run if you so chose in the UI folder for the React code. I have the requirements.txt in the root directory simply because I run the playwright E2E testing with pytest (along with the Lambda unit test/s).
